    <p>Hello! My name is Randon Alford. I'm an aspiring (not so young) coder who has been working towards a
        new career in coding and web development. This is an exciting and challenging new direction for me!
    </p>
    <p>After school, my career has been almost exclusively in retail. I've been responsible for selling jewelry, shoes,
        electronics, cell phones, and sports memorabilia. Going from using my words, to now using
        my fingers to sell myself to someone, is a <strong>VERY</strong> different experience! It has definitely been much
        more of a workout for my brain.
    </p>
    <p>I hope you'll enjoy looking through the different projects that I have been working on since I started
        this journey in 2018. I know I've enjoyed making them! 
    </p>
